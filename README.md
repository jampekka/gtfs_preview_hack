A quick hack to visualize and compare GTFS shapes using geojson.io.

The GTFS shapes are converted to GeoJson using the
`gtfs_shape_to_geojson.py` script, eg:

    ./gtfs_shape_to_geojson.py gtfs_shape_preview/data path/to/shapes.txt

These can be then viewed in a browser (tested only with Chromium)
by opening the `gtfs_shape_preview/index.html`. To avoid having a
HTTP server, chromium can be run with `--disable-web-security` flag
eg `chromium --disable-web-security gtfs_shape_preview/data/index.html`.
Otherwise you'll need to launch a HTTP server serving the `gtfs_shape_preview`
directory with CORS headers enabled.

Two shapes.txt-files with different versions of same shapes can be compared
by adding another shapes.txt with the -b parameter:
    
    ./gtfs_shape_to_geojson.py gtfs_shape_preview/data -b path/to/other/shapes.txt path/to/shapes.txt

Some stats can be included by using including a stats file generated by
using `gtfs_shape_mapfit` with the -s parameter:

    ./gtfs_shape_to_geojson.py gtfs_shape_preview/data -b path/to/other/shapes.txt -s path/to/fitter.log path/to/shapes.txt
